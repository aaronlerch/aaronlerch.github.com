For the past 6 months to a year, I've been getting more and more into
web development on the side (I used to be a web developer, a long time
ago.) I've been focusing exclusively on ruby-based frameworks. It serves
two purposes, I get to learn a new language, and there are plenty of
options out there for me to explore.

In that spirit, instead of changing the focus of my [existing
blog](http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/), I'm
going to take a cue from [Ben
Scheirman](http://benscheirman.com/blog/2011/08/17/a-fresh-start/) and
start a new blog and just start updating this one more often. Which,
given the number of things going on in my life right now, will not be
often at all. :)

If you haven't checked out [octopress](http://octopress.org/) you should it's pretty sweet! I love the idea of a file-based blog engine using git.
