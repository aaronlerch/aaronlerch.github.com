It's been a long time since I've spent significant time to learn an
entirely new technology. And I've had a blast digging into ruby, rails,
sinatra, padrino, javascript (okay, I really mean jQuery), and tons of
other related frameworks. In spite of some of the excellent, and
not-so-excellent, documentation out there, it can be an incredibly
frustrating experience. Especially when trying to learn something new --
like something *really new* -- not just new to me. Expect to see posts
here related to what I'm learning, that make as few assumptions as
possible about what you already know.

For example, I recently worked on getting a test environment set up for
my app that involves sinatra, mongoid, and twilio APIs. It was an
interesting experience. I'm sure seasoned ruby devs wouldn't have had
the same issues, but I'm a firm believer in "you're not alone" so I'll
be posting about the process to hopefully help someone else in my shoes.
